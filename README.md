# Problem Statement

## Step 1 – Display following UI components.

> (A) – an empty div.
> (B) – 5 circles each of unique colours. The colour generation method should randomly pick
> and assign one of the five colours to the circles. However, a colour cannot be duplicated.
> © - A text box that will take numeric input and a button named “shoot”

## Step 2 –

> A user can enter a number in the text box and click shoot button. This would move the corresponding circle into the empty div. In the figure below, user entered 2 and clicked shoot button, which moved the 2nd circle into the empty div.

## Step 3 –

> The circles get reorganised. Therefore the purple circle which was at 3rd position now moves up and occupies 2nd position.

## Step 4 -

> The user can shoot multiple circles and the corresponding circles would move in to the empty div. In the below figure, the user again entered 3 and corresponding circle got moved into the empty div.

## Step 5 –

> The user can get back the circles that were shot by clicking the corresponding circles residing in the empty div. Example the user clicked yellow circle which was inside the empty div and the yellow came back to its original position (that is second position). Please note that this is important consideration in the problem.

## Step 6 –

> Continuing with step 5, clicking the blue circle restores it’s original position that is 4th.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
